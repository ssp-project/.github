# Hi there 👋 &nbsp;Welcome to the **SSP Project** organization!

SecureShare Protocol (SSP) is an open-source effort to build a **private, invitation-only peer-to-peer ecosystem** for secure file exchange and real-time communication.  
Think of it as a modern, zero-knowledge alternative to legacy systems like classic Usenet or public BitTorrent—**without exposing identities, metadata, or public IP addresses**.

---

## 🌟 What we’re aiming to achieve
1. **Truly private networks** – each SSP network is a self-contained, invite-only space you fully control.  
2. **End-to-end confidentiality** – everything (content *and* metadata) is encrypted; operators can never read user data.  
3. **Unified node model** – a single Rust binary can act as entry, storage, chat, or relay node, making deployment straightforward.  
4. **Multi-platform clients** – desktop (Rust + egui) and Android (Kotlin) apps share a common core.  
5. **Granular access control** – token-based roles (Owner → Admin → Moderator → Power / Standard).  
6. **Resilience & federation** – optional alliances between networks allow resource sharing, disaster recovery, and cross-search while maintaining independence.

## 🔑 Core Principles
• **Security first** – modern cryptography by default (Noise XX, ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519, BLAKE3, optional post-quantum hybrids).  
• **Zero-knowledge architecture** – the network stores what it cannot read.  
• **Transparency** – open code, open specs, continuous community review.  
• **User autonomy** – you decide who joins, what’s shared, and how long it lives.  
• **No speculation / no tokenomics** – contribution and reputation, not coins, drive quality of service.
